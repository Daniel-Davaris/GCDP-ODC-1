<h2>Research and development project for Open Data Connect </h2>
<hr>
<p>The initial aim of this project is to analyse Garmin data from users’ wearables. This can be achieved individually by simply logging in to Garmin connect and exporting your data. However, the aim of this project is to leverage the Garmin Connect Developer Program (which requires you to request access) to authenticate various users to a Garmin ‘app’ (Which is just an API consumer key and secret). For this, we will need to setup our own web server as the Garmin API only works from server to server. We will also need to configure endpoints from the Garmin developer portal, from there our server will need to actively listen in to receive data from Garmin.  </p>
